My research is mainly focused on operator algebras and their applications to geometry. Most days of the week, an operator algebra is a collection of continuous linear transformations of a normed vector space, closed with respect to compositions, linear combinations, and some choice of topology. The fun starts when one sees how many constructions from far flung areas of mathematics land in this arena. Prominently, one has the whole industry of noncommutative geometry, established by Alain Connes. Here, we seek out ways to understand geometric situations, especially those resistant to classical methods, by understanding associated operator algebras. In this way, we are able to bring to bear the powerful theorems of functional analysis, as well as powerful invariants, especially operator K-theory and its friends. These days, one feels more and more that most of the constructions which give us interesting operator algebras pass--not always in a obvious way--through the world of (topological, smooth, etc) groupoids. Accordingly, the business of attaching groupoids to geometrical situations is very much deserving of attention from people interested in applying operator theory to geometry, or vice versa!
